## Hello!

This is my NextJs project that I wanted to do for a long time. 
I recently finished NextJs course, and because of that, I wanted to use this knowledge to create something with it!

Soo.. 

This is a full stack page, hosted using Vercel on this link: 
https://my-blog-seven-gamma.vercel.app/

What I've learned:
- NextJs pre-rendering stuff
- Using getStaticProps, getStaticPaths
- Using Next/Link, Next/Image
- Using Syntax Higlighter from React
- Using markdown files and showing them on screen!
- Configuring _app and _document files
- Storing files in correct folders

This project can be a template for your own blog, only thing you have to provide is .md files and images in 'posts' folders!

On this blog we have:
